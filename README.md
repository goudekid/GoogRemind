Reminders based on hours elapsed after you've turned on your PC, just set it as a launch application with windows


My sleep schedule is in a constant state of fucked and I basically live on my PC, so I can easily remember to do things I need to do (but that don't have to be done at any certain time) in a given day by reminding myself based on x hours after my computer turns on.

essentially this is my lifehack to remember to change the cat litter 1 hour after I wake up and 12 hours after I wake up, and stuff like that
